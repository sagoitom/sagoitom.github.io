My name is Saron Goitom and I’m a PhD student in the Department of Epidemiology at UC 
Berkeley's School of Public Health. My current research interests include contextualizing 
the way in which stressful life events during pregnancy influence their children's 
internalizing behaviors in early childhood, by examining the influence of larger 
structural factors like poverty, trauma, racism and discrimination. I hope to advance my 
training in methods for analyzing observational data, with the goal of isolating causal 
pathways from harmful structural factors to child mental health outcomes.
